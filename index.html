        <p class="about-summary">
          <strong><span class="highlight">Anyone can sing...</span></strong> it just takes the right mentor. For me as a child it was hard to find someone who could help me transform my voice. But through experience and training my voice grew to be what I am today. All it takes is patience and hard work. And this studio gives you the chance to rediscover <strong><span class="highlight">the lost echo</span></strong> in you.
