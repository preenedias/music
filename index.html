                </div>
                <p>Music has always been more than just sound for me—it was a faithful companion from childhood, a voice that spoke even when words fell short. I grew up fascinated by the way melodies could brighten moods, stir emotions, and tell stories without uttering a single syllable. What began as innocent curiosity—humming along to tunes, trying to imitate rhythms—slowly deepened into an unwavering dedication. This love for expression, this realization that music could both mirror and move the soul, is what firmly set me on the path of music.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="about-point-item">
                <div class="about-point-image">
                  <img src="images/training.jpg" alt="Preene's formal training" />
                </div>
                <p>To transform passion into true artistry, I pursued formal training under seasoned mentors who not only shaped my technique but also my mindset as a musician. The journey was a blend of discipline and discovery—rigorous daily practice, immersion in theory, and mastery of stage techniques that sharpened my confidence and versatility. Through this process, I began to appreciate the layers of music beyond its surface beauty: the science of sound, the art of performance, and the discipline that anchors both. Training didn’t just make me a better musician; it made me a more grounded artist who understands the responsibility that comes with sharing music.</p>

                  <img src="images/certificate.jpg" alt="Preene's certifications" />
                </div>
                <p>Along this journey of growth, I have earned certifications that serve as both recognition and reinforcement of my commitment to music. Each certification represents countless hours of practice, learning, and reflection. More than just credentials, they are milestones—moments where I could pause, look back at the effort invested, and look forward with renewed determination. These achievements not only added credibility to my craft but also gave me the confidence to explore broader horizons, experiment with new forms, and continually expand my artistic vocabulary.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Performance has been the true test and reward of this journey. I have had the privilege of performing at several major events, each stage adding a new dimension to my growth as an artist. Every performance has been more than just an opportunity to present my work; it has been a chance to connect—sometimes with strangers, sometimes with familiar faces—through the universal language of music. These experiences have taught me the profound bond between performer and listener, a shared emotional space where music becomes the bridge. With each event, I have grown not only in skill but also in the ability to share pieces of myself with the world through sound.</p>
